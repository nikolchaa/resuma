Entry:
${JSON.stringify(entry, null, 2)}

Evaluate whether this entry is relevant to the job description based strictly on skills, tools, or tasks mentioned. Ignore dates, years of experience, and time-based requirements. For education entries, relevance means the field of study aligns with the job, even if courses don't match. For skill categories or groups, keep the entry if at least one item is even slightly relevant.

Respond ONLY with "yes" or "no" â€” no explanations, no formatting.

If the job description is empty or you're unsure, assume the entry IS relevant.`;

Modify the description and notes fields to make them clearer, more concise, and directly relevant to the job description. You can add new notes, but do not remove any existing notes. Keep all other fields the same (dates, locations, etc.). Do not add new information not related to the job description. Return the updated entry as a JSON object only, no codeblock formatting.
