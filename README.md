Resuma is an open-source desktop application for building beautiful, professional resumes using local AI models. With the default local setup, your data never leaves your device.

Powered by Tauri, Rust, React (TSX), and llama.cpp, Resuma brings the power of private AI directly to your desktop, ensuring fast performance and complete privacy. If you would rather use a model you already host or pay for, you can point it at Ollama, LM Studio, or a cloud API with your own key instead.

> ⚡ **Local by default**: No external servers unless you configure one yourself.

> ⚡ **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
